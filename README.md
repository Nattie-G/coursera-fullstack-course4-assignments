## notes on the assignments
### #1
- There was no assignment in week 1
### #2
- I experimented with presentation in this week's assignment.
- I used colours from https://github.com/rose-pine/rose-pine-theme and box shadows to create a more appealing design then the boring default greys, blacks, and whites
### #3
- this week was all about using twitter bootstrap but since the course is 2015 era, relies on a fairly old version.
- I took extra time to study the documentation for bootstrap to update the assignment to run on bootstrap 5.1.
### 4 & 5
- assignments 4 & 5 were fairly simple js tasks
- assignment 5 uses bootstrap 3.x again because the weeks tasks were focused on JS
